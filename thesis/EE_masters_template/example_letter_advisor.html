Re: Permission to include co-authored material in dissertation

Dear Dean Mason;

	&lt;Delilah Gradstudent&gt;  (Student ID# <12345678>) has been conducting 
research under my supervision while she has been a graduate student at 
the University of California, Berkeley. She has also collaborated with 
several researchers outside the University and produced co-authored 
publications with those individuals. I have reviewed this work and it
is comparable to work conducted under the direct supervision of a Berkeley
faculty member. &lt;Delilah&gt; conducted an integral component of the research. 
The two chapters based on publication with Dr. &lt;Publishalot&gt; are worthy of 
inclusion in her dissertation. 

I have attached copies of the co-authored publications that will be 
included in &lt;Delilah's&gt; dissertation, along with a copy of a letter of
support from Dr &lt;Publishalot&gt;.

Sincerely,


Dr. Philip. D. Advisor
University of California, Berkeley
